## Is your art childish?


Try it! http://neurodeep.shinyapps.io/artcritic
###This app uses a deep neural network to analyze your uploaded artwork and determine if it was produced by a child or a professional artist!

I created a labeled data set of professional abstract artwork and drawings by children and then used transfer learning to train a deep neural network to classify art as either "childish" or "art"

This project uses Keras for R with Tensorflow and is deployed using Shiny
